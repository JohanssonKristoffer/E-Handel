Strength:
Our product are of great quality, due to this we have a lot of word-of-mouth advertisement.

Weakness:
Since we do not yet have an online store our customers are forced to do their shopping at a physical store, inconveniancing them.

Opportunity:
If we buy an online-websstore we will be able to sell items online as well as stores, satisfying our customers who are less
inclined to do their shopping at stores.
This might increase our sales due to the fact that customers no longer have to travel to our stores, but rather can buy the items
from their homes. 
We will also be able to advertise for free on our own website, tailoring all ads to the customer thats logged in.

Threat:
Our customers who value conveniance are likely to go to a competitor that has an online webstore. This leads to a loss in sales.
